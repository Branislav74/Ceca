 <h3>Discover Lefkada</h3>
 <p>Porto Katsiki, Egremnoi, Kathisma – clear blue waters and awarded beaches: this is the first image that comes 
   to mind when someone thinks of Lefkada. However this hospitable Ionian island is a destination that has a 
   lot more to offer than just beaches. Green trails, unspoiled landscapes, awarded beaches, traditional villages 
   and gastronomic surprises. Lefkada fulfills every holiday need and covers every taste and every type of 
   accommodation. Admire its sights, try the delicious food, take a cruise and relax on beautiful beaches.</p>
   <p>Suggested routes around the island combine lively tourist areas and villages where life 
     goes on in the tempo of the past, and villagers go about their work -or spend their time as they always 
     have- 
     sites of historical interest and beaches such as you have never seen, the gentle charm of eastern Lefkada and the wild beauties of the west, and the very different hinterland of the interior. 

      This is a good way to get to know the island. To know it well, however, is a different matter . It goes without saying that these routes may be adapted to your wishes and mood, and your means of transport. Also, some routes can be combined with others.</p>
  <h3 id="lefkada">Activities in Lefkada</h3>
  <p>Right from the first moment one can find a thousand things to do throughout the island. If you are addicted to action or a supporter of relaxation be sure that Lefkada offers a wide selection of sport activities or excursions for all people of all ages. In Lefkada you can find licensed schools for windsurfing, kitesurfing, sailing, diving, waterskiing, paragliding, horsing, mountain-biking, hiking and other sports. Sailing holidays in Lefkada can be a great experience. The Ionian inland sea, enclosed by Lefkada and its surrounding islands, Madouri, Skorpios, Meganisi, Kalamos, Kastos, is the perfect area for a boat rental or a yacht charter. You can also go island-hopping from the main port of Nydri where you can organize a cruise day trip to the nearby beaches and islands. If you like adventure and want to explore things by your own you can rent a car or a motor-bike. Food in Lefkada is for all tastes too - as stomach can be the most direct way to get to know a culture- and in large portions, either you prefer local Greek recipes with fish, meat or vegetables or international dishes. The island is full of tavernas, coffee shops, beach bars and cocktail bars. Night life in Lefkada has also many options for entertainment since many beach bars and cocktail bars turn to a disco- club during the night. Don’t forget the cultural events, to visit a museum, to find your favourite book. Think about yourself and enjoy some beauty treats like spa, massage and yoga. Let the children have fun while you just sit and enjoy your beverage. There are many playgrounds and children friendly areas in Lefkada. And either you like or dislike shopping, don’t loose the opportunity to enter a local store and check out for Lefkada’s traditional products.</p>
